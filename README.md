# Welcome to the W.A.D.E Lab GitHub site
This site is a general location for tools and code used by the W.A.D.E. Lab, and mainly contains two types of repository: general lab tools (e.g. the Lab Guide, Code of Conduct, generalized pipelines for genome alignment or metabarcoding QAQC, etc.) and project-based repositories, each containing the code and metadata used to generate W.A.D.E. Lab publications.
